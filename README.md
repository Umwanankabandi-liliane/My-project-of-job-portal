## Description

This Job Portal allows:

- **Job Seekers** to sign up, log in, search for jobs, and apply.
- **Employers** to sign up, log in, and post job openings.

**Note:** The site is currently functional only in terms of the user interface. The backend (which connects everything together) is still under development, and the functionality of features like user registration, job posting, etc., is not yet working.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For creating the structure of the website.
- **CSS**: For styling the website.
- **JavaScript**: For interactive elements like buttons.
- **Django**: For the backend (still under development).

## How to Set Up

Follow these steps to run the Job Portal frontend on your computer:

### 1. Clone the Project

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Umwanankabandi-liliane/My-project-of-job-portal.git
```

### 2. Open the Project Folder

Navigate to the project folder:

```bash
cd My-project-of-job-portal
```

### 3. Open `index.html`

You can open the `index.html` file directly in your web browser. Simply double-click it, or use a code editor (like Visual Studio Code) to open it and run it live.

**Note:** Since the backend is not yet set up, you will only see the frontend design. Features like logging in or posting jobs are not functional yet.

## Features

- **Job seekers can view jobs**: The job listings page will show available job opportunities.
- **Employers can see their job posts**: Employers will see their job listings (though adding new posts is not yet functional).
- **Responsive design**: The layout looks good on different screen sizes (desktop and mobile).

## Limitations

- **No Backend**: The backend functionality (such as login, registration, and posting jobs) is not working yet.
- **Static Pages**: The pages are static and don't interact with a database. Features like applying for a job or posting a job are placeholders for future development.
